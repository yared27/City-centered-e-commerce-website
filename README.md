Project Title: Implementation of Software Tools and Practices in Checking and Ordering

Course: Software Tools and Practices

Project Description:
Welcome to 40gebeya, an eCommerce platform developed by the students of SENG-G3 Section A Group 4 at Arba Minch University's Faculty of Software Engineering. As part of our Software Tools and Practices course, we embarked on creating a comprehensive digital marketplace to apply various software tools and best practices.

Tools Used:
1. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): We relied on Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for efficient coding and collaboration. Its extensive features and extensions facilitated seamless development.
2. Development Environment: Initially, we chose XAMPP but later shifted to Wamp due to technical challenges. Wamp provided a robust local server environment for smooth development and testing.
3. Live Server Extension: VS Code's Live Server extension allowed real-time preview and debugging of web pages, boosting productivity and reducing turnaround time for code modifications.
4. Bing Copilot: Leveraging AI-powered code debugging tool Bing Copilot, we efficiently debugged and received code suggestions, enhancing our development process.

Project Focus:
Our primary focus was to develop a robust e-commerce system with essential functionalities such as user authentication, product management, shopping cart management, and order processing. We strived to incorporate additional features like Ajax and JavaScript to add dynamism, despite facing time constraints.

Acknowledgement:
We extend heartfelt thanks to our instructors for their invaluable guidance and support. Additionally, we express gratitude to our peers and the university faculty for their encouragement and understanding during this project.

 Note:
Due to time constraints, our system may lack error handling and documentation might be incomplete. Please use the platform carefully. We've done our best within the given time frame, but improvements are ongoing.
